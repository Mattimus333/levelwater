                    This year the American Society of Civil Engineers evaluated the USA\'s drinking water infrastructure and rated it a \'D\'. There are 155,000 public water systems in the country, the majority of which are smaller systems that lack the economies of scale and the technical, manegerial, and financial capacity that large systems have. This lack of asset management means that many are not meeting state requirements or those of the Safe Drinking Water Act, and may be one capital malfunction away from going bankrupt and leaving their customers dry.
