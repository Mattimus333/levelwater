At levelwater.io, we believe that America's drinking water should be safe to drink and affordable. We have developed a user-friendly, low-overhead asset management tool to give public water systems the power to plan for the future.

levelwater.io allows public water systems to develop an inventory of critical assets, such as year of construction, current condition, capacity, and other factors. Our analysis will then calculate the remaining useful life of user assets and provide cost estimates for replacement. Using this information, public water systems can set water rates that capture the full cost of providing water and anticipate when major capital investments should be expected.

levelwater.io was created by Ryan Thissen, Matt Muhr, Sasha Berkowitz, and Alex Krawiec.
